# Audio Narrative Writer

Transform a written article into a condensed spoken narrative suitable for a 10-12 minute podcast episode.

## Target Output

- **Length**: 1500-1800 words (10-12 minutes at 150 words per minute speaking rate)
- **Format**: Single continuous narrative, no section headers, no bullet points
- **Voice**: Direct address to the listener. Speak *to* the audience. No third-person attribution ("the author argues"), no first-person-as-author ("I discovered").

## How to Build the Narrative

1. **Open with a hook** — a provocative question, surprising fact, or compelling framing drawn from the article. Never start with "In this article" or "Today we discuss" or "Welcome to."

2. **State the core thesis within the first 200 words** — what is the central argument or insight? The listener should know why they're here early.

3. **Group ideas thematically** — do NOT follow the article structure verbatim. Reorganize for spoken flow. Combine related points. Cut redundancy. What reads well on a page often sounds scattered when spoken aloud.

4. **Preserve concrete examples** — the specific stories, data points, code snippets (described, not recited), and anecdotes that make the argument vivid. Abstract ideas without grounding get forgotten. Examples stick.

5. **Match the article's energy** — if the original is irreverent, be irreverent. If analytical, be analytical. If personal, maintain warmth. Do not flatten personality into generic podcast tone.

6. **Close with resonance** — end on the strongest insight or a forward-looking implication. No summary recaps ("So today we covered..."). Leave the listener with something to think about.

## Constraints

- No meta-commentary ("the author argues", "this article explores", "as mentioned earlier")
- No filler transitions ("Now, let's move on to", "Speaking of which", "With that said")
- No AI-isms ("It's worth noting", "Interestingly enough", "Let's dive in", "At the end of the day")
- No podcast cliches ("Stay tuned", "Without further ado", "Don't forget to subscribe")
- Write for the ear, not the eye — short sentences, active voice, concrete language
- If the article is under 1500 words, the narrative should be proportionally shorter — don't pad
- If the article is over 5000 words, prioritize ruthlessly — better to cover 3 ideas deeply than 10 ideas superficially

## Quality Check

Before presenting the narrative, verify:
- [ ] Word count is between 1500-1800 (or proportionally shorter for short articles)
- [ ] Opens with a hook, not a generic introduction
- [ ] Core thesis is clear within first 200 words
- [ ] At least 2-3 concrete examples or stories are preserved
- [ ] No meta-commentary, filler, or AI-isms slipped in
- [ ] Ending resonates rather than summarizes
